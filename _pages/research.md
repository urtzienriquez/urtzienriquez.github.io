My research focuses on amphibians and reptiles

### Range margins
Given that the climate is changing at unprecedented rates, one of my research interests involves understanding how species range margins will shift.

### Phenotypic evolution
I have explored the evolution of morphological and physiological traits both at the species and population levels.
